# Projects

DMD 100 has three projects, one in user experience and interface prototyping, interactive storytelling, and open product design. These are difficult projects and have been divided into achievable deliverables that follow the Double Diamond design process.

## Submitting projects

When project tasks are completed, they are submitted to Canvas. The course uses discussions and group work in Canvas so students can participate in the feedback and iterative process that is crucial in design and creative fields.
